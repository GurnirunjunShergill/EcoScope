## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend

* [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/docs) (App Router)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
* [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US) for graphs
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) or Mapbox for maps
* Lighthouse/a11y optimization

### Backend

* Node.js + TypeScript
* [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
* [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) + PostgreSQL (with PostGIS)
* [node-cron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron) for scheduled jobs
* Redis for caching (optional)

### Scraping

* [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
* NOAA, EPA, OpenAQ, NREL APIs
* Store raw + processed data in database

### Infrastructure

* Monorepo setup (e.g., Turborepo or npm workspaces)
* Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Railway or Fly.io (backend), Supabase or Neon (DB)
* GitHub Actions CI/CD

## 🗓️ 8-Week Roadmap

### Week 1: Planning & Setup

* Identify 2–3 public data sources
* Set up monorepo with workspaces
* Scaffold frontend, backend, scraper, and db
* Define initial DB schema (locations, AQI, solar, etc.)
* Pick brand direction, fonts, and color palette

### Week 2: Scraper MVP

* Build scraper for OpenAQ & NREL APIs
* Store fetched data into PostgreSQL
* Schedule re-fetch using cron

### Week 3: Backend API

* Build Fastify API with routes:

  * `GET /climate?zip=90210`
  * `GET /solar?lat=34.1&lng=-118.3`
  * `GET /trends/temperature?city=Detroit`
* Add validation, logging, and basic caching

### Week 4: Frontend MVP

* Build search UI: enter zip/city
* Dashboard to show fetched data (AQI, temperature, solar score)
* Integrate charts (Recharts)

### Week 5: UI Expansion

* Add maps (EV stations, solar potential)
* Add historic trend graphs
* Add incentives data (static first, then scraped)

### Week 6: Infra & Performance

* Add Redis caching for API responses
* Optimize frontend for Lighthouse + a11y
* CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions)

### Week 7: Monetization Features

* Add Stripe integration (for paid reports or dashboard access)
* Email sign-up + climate updates (Resend, Postmark)
* Create pricing page + usage tiering

### Week 8: Final Polish & Launch

* Polish design, mobile responsiveness
* Final SEO, meta tags, sitemap
* Deploy, share on LinkedIn, Reddit, etc.
